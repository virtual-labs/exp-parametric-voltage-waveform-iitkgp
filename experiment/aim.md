## Aim of the experiment

- For measurement of spark-over and withstand voltages of various test objects.
- HV testing engineers are also the group of people who benefits, apart from academic and industry personnel.
- To study the behavior of output impulse voltage pulse by variation of different circuit parameters like the front and tail resistors and inductors and complying with IEC 60060-1.
- Enables safe setting up of the experiment in minimal time.
- Ensures thorough learning of the concepts involved in IVG before stepping into the physical laboratory.
